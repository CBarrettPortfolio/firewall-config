# Project: Configuring Firewall Interfaces with pfSense

## Description:
This project involves configuring firewall interfaces with pfSense as part of the Network Security, Firewalls, and VPNs lab assessment from the third edition. The lab assessment covers hands-on demonstrations, physical configuration planning, interface configurations, and verification of firewall implementations.

## Lab Tasks:
1. Plan the Physical Configuration of the Firewall:
   - Capture the completed General tab of the Planner.
   - Capture the completed WAN and LAN tabs of the Physical Configuration worksheet.

2. Configure the LAN and WAN Firewall Interfaces:
   - Capture LAN and WAN interfaces on the pfSense WebGUI dashboard.

3. Verify the Firewall Implementation:
   - Capture successful ICMP requests to pfSense's upstream gateway and WAN interface.

4. Applied Learning:
   - Plan the Physical Configuration of the Firewall:
     - Capture the completed DMZ tab of the Physical Configuration worksheet.
   - Configure the DMZ Firewall Interface:
     - Capture the DMZ interface on the pfSense WebGUI dashboard.
   - Verify the Firewall Implementation:
     - Capture successful ICMP request to the DMZ interface.

5. Challenge and Analysis:
   - Configure and Test Split DNS on pfSense:
     - Capture Host Override entries in the DNS Resolver.
     - Capture successful nslookup test for both DNS entries.
   - Enable and Test Secure Shell Access on pfSense:
     - Capture the enabled option for SSH access.
     - Capture successful SSH connection.
